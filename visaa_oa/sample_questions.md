Let me help you understand this problem and provide a detailed solution.

# Running Sum with Adjacent Elements

## Problem Understanding
- Input: Array of integers (let's call it `a`)
- Task: For each position i, calculate sum of (previous + current + next) elements
- For first and last elements, we only take two elements since there's no previous/next element respectively

## Example
```
Input array a:  [0, 3, 4, 67, 2]
Output array b: [3, 7, 74, 73, 69]
```

Let's solve this step by step:

## Solution Code
```python
def calculate_running_sum(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Initialize result array with zeros
    result = [0] * n
    
    # Handle first element (no previous element)
    # b[0] = a[0] + a[1]
    result[0] = arr[0] + arr[1]
    
    # Handle middle elements
    # b[i] = a[i-1] + a[i] + a[i+1]
    for i in range(1, n-1):
        result[i] = arr[i-1] + arr[i] + arr[i+1]
    
    # Handle last element (no next element)
    # b[n-1] = a[n-2] + a[n-1]
    result[n-1] = arr[n-2] + arr[n-1]
    
    return result

# Handle multiple test cases
t = int(input())  # Number of test cases
for _ in range(t):
    # Convert input string to list of integers
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Note: Changed from input() to input().split()
    result = calculate_running_sum(arr)
    print(result)
```

## Detailed Explanation

1. **Function Definition**:
   - We create a function `calculate_running_sum` that takes an array as input

2. **Array Initialization**:
   - Create result array (`result`) with same length as input array, filled with zeros

3. **Special Cases**:
   - First element (index 0):
     - Only sum current and next element
     - `result[0] = arr[0] + arr[1]`
   - Last element (index n-1):
     - Only sum current and previous element
     - `result[n-1] = arr[n-2] + arr[n-1]`

4. **Middle Elements**:
   - For each element from index 1 to n-2:
     - Sum previous, current, and next elements
     - `result[i] = arr[i-1] + arr[i] + arr[i+1]`

5. **Example Walkthrough**:
   For array `[0, 3, 4, 67, 2]`:
   ```
   Index 0: b[0] = 0 + 3 = 3
   Index 1: b[1] = 0 + 3 + 4 = 7
   Index 2: b[2] = 3 + 4 + 67 = 74
   Index 3: b[3] = 4 + 67 + 2 = 73
   Index 4: b[4] = 67 + 2 = 69
   ```

## Important Fixes from Original Code
1. Changed `input()` to `input().split()` in array input to properly handle space-separated integers
2. Separated the logic into a function for better organization
3. Made the code more readable with clear comments

## Edge Cases to Consider
- Array must have at least 2 elements
- Input validation could be added
- Could handle single-element array as a special case if needed
