# Understanding the Problem and Concepts

## What is a Substring?
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. 
- Example: For the string "hello"
  - Substrings include: "h", "he", "hel", "hell", "hello"
  - Note that substrings must be continuous characters

## What is a Palindrome?
A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward.
- Example: 
  - "radar" is a palindrome
  - "hello" is NOT a palindrome

## Key Concepts in the Code

### 1. Reversing a String (Without Built-in Functions)
```python
def reverse(s):
    r_s = ""
    for char in s:
        r_s = char + r_s  # Add each character to the beginning
    return r_s
```
- This function manually reverses a string
- How it works:
  - Start with an empty string
  - Take each character from the original string
  - Add it to the front of the new string
- Example: 
  - Input: "hello"
  - Process: "" → "h" → "he" → "hel" → "hell" → "hello"

### 2. Palindrome Checking
```python
if s == reverse(s):
    print("This string is a palindrome")
else:
    print("It's not a palindrome")
```
- Compares the original string with its reverse
- If they're identical, it's a palindrome

### 3. Finding Palindromic Substrings
```python
count = 0
for i in range(0, len(s)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(s)):
        # Check if substring is a palindrome
        if s[i:j] == reverse(s[i:j]):
            count += 1
            print(s[i:j])
```
- Uses nested loops to generate all possible substrings
- Outer loop (i): starting point of substring
- Inner loop (j): ending point of substring
- Checks each substring to see if it's a palindrome

## Important Notes
- Strings are immutable in Python (cannot be changed in-place)
- Time complexity of substring check is O(n²)
- Total number of substrings for a string of length n is n*(n+1)/2

## Complete Code Explanation
```python
# Number of test cases
t = int(input())

# Loop through each test case
for i in range(0, t):
    # Input the string
    s = input()
    
    # Reverse the string function
    def reverse(s):
        r_s = ""
        for char in s:
            r_s = char + r_s
        return r_s
    
    # Check if whole string is a palindrome
    if s == reverse(s):
        print("This string is a palindrome")
    else:
        print("It's not a palindrome")
    
    # Find palindromic substrings
    count = 0
    for i in range(0, len(s)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(s)):
            # Check if substring is a palindrome
            if s[i:j] == reverse(s[i:j]):
                count += 1
                print(s[i:j])
    
    # Print total count of palindromic substrings
    print(f"The number of palindromic substrings is {count}")
```

## Example Walkthrough
- Input: "ytuy"
- Palindromic Substrings:
  1. "y"
  2. "t"
  3. "u"
  4. "tuy"

## Potential Improvements
- Optimize substring checking
- Handle edge cases
- Improve time complexity
